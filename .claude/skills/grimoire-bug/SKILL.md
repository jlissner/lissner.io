# grimoire-bug

Disciplined bug fix workflow: reproduce first, then fix. Every bug gets a failing test before any code changes.

## Triggers

- User reports a bug, defect, or unexpected behavior
- User says something is "broken", "wrong", "not working"
- Loose match: "bug", "fix", "broken", "defect", "issue", "regression"

## Routing

- Tester/non-developer reporting a bug → `grimoire-bug-report`
- Feature request disguised as a bug → `grimoire-draft`
- Performance issue → handle directly (profiling, not repro test)
- Configuration error → just fix the config

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Bug

Get enough information to reproduce:

- **What happened** — the actual behavior
- **What should happen** — the expected behavior
- **How to trigger it** — steps to reproduce

If the user's report is vague, ask one clarifying question. Don't start fixing until you can describe the reproduction steps.

### 2. Classify the Bug

**Check existing feature files** — `grep -rn '<keyword from bug>' features/` to find scenarios describing the expected behavior.

**Scenario exists** → The spec is right, the code is wrong. This is a pure implementation bug. Skip to step 3.

**No scenario covers this behavior** → The bug reveals a gap in the specs. This is a missing scenario. Before fixing:

1. Write a new scenario (or add to an existing feature) that describes the correct behavior
2. Add it directly to `features/` (not through a full grimoire change — this is a gap fill, not new functionality)
3. Note in a comment or commit message that this scenario was added to cover a discovered bug

**Scenario is wrong** → Rare, but possible. The spec itself describes incorrect behavior. Flag this to the user — it may need a grimoire draft to update the feature properly.

### 3. Write a Reproduction Test

Before touching any production code:

1. Write a step definition (or unit test if no BDD scenario applies) that exercises the exact bug conditions
2. Run it — **it MUST FAIL**, reproducing the bug
3. If it passes, your test doesn't actually reproduce the bug. Fix the test until it fails for the right reason.

This is non-negotiable. A bug fix without a reproduction test is a guess that might work. A failing test is proof you understand the problem.

### 4. Document the Bug

Create a brief record in the test or commit. No separate tracking file needed — the test IS the documentation.

The reproduction test should make the bug obvious:

```gherkin
# Bug: users with special characters in email can't reset password
Scenario: Password reset with plus-sign email
  Given a user exists with email "test+alias@example.com"
  When they request a password reset
  Then they should receive a reset email
```

Or as a unit test comment:

```python
def test_password_reset_special_chars():
    """Bug: email addresses with + were being URL-encoded in the reset
    link, causing lookup failures. Reported 2026-04-05."""
```

The commit message should reference the bug:

```
fix(auth): handle special characters in password reset emails

Plus signs in email addresses were URL-encoded during reset link
generation, causing user lookup to fail on the reset page.

Added scenario: "Password reset with plus-sign email"
```

### 5. Create Fix Branch

Before writing any code, create a branch for the fix:

```
fix/<short-description>
```

For example: `fix/special-chars-password-reset`, `fix/null-pricing-response`.

### 6. Fix the Bug

Now — and only now — modify production code:

1. Make the smallest change that fixes the failing test
2. Run the reproduction test — it should pass
3. Run ALL existing tests — no regressions
4. If the fix is more than a few lines, pause and consider whether the approach is the simplest one

**Escalation guard:** If the fix requires changes to more than 3 files, introduces new abstractions, modifies data models, or crosses service boundaries — STOP. This is not a bug fix, it's a change that needs design. Tell the user: "This fix is larger than a typical bug fix. I recommend routing to `grimoire-draft` to handle this as a proper change with specs and a plan." The user can override.

### 7. Verify

- Reproduction test passes (`config.tools.bdd_test`)
- All existing feature scenarios pass (`config.tools.bdd_test`)
- All existing unit/integration tests pass (`config.tools.unit_test`)
- If a new scenario was added in step 2, it passes with the fix

### 8. Tester Verification Checklist

After the fix, generate a checklist for testers to verify the fix and check for regressions. This bridges the gap between "developer says it's fixed" and "tester confirms it's fixed."

1. **Confirm the original bug** — restate the exact reproduction steps from the report and what the tester should now see instead.

2. **Check related areas** — identify 3-5 areas that could have been affected by the fix:
   - Other scenarios in the same feature file
   - Features that share the same code path or data (check what the fix touched)
   - Edge cases near the fix — if you fixed a null check, what about empty strings? If you fixed one role, what about other roles?

3. **Generate the checklist:**

```markdown
## Verification Checklist: <bug-id>

Fix branch: `fix/<name>`

### Original Bug

- [ ] Reproduce the original steps: <steps>
- [ ] Confirm expected behavior: <what should happen now>

### Regression Checks

- [ ] <related scenario or area>: <what to verify>
- [ ] <related scenario or area>: <what to verify>
- [ ] <related scenario or area>: <what to verify>
```

4. **Include in bug report** — append the checklist to `.grimoire/bugs/<bug-id>/report.md` (or the triage file if it exists) so the tester can find it.

5. If an external ticket exists, post the checklist as a comment so the tester doesn't need to look at local files.

### 9. Summary

Report to the user:

- What the bug was (root cause, not symptoms)
- What was changed (files and what specifically)
- Whether a new scenario was added to cover the gap
- Test results
- The verification checklist for testers (from step 8)

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Feature requests disguised as bugs** — "it's broken because it doesn't do X" when X was never specified. Route to `grimoire-draft`.
- **Performance issues** — these usually need profiling, not a repro test. Handle directly.
- **Configuration errors** — wrong env vars, missing dependencies, bad setup. Just fix the config.

## Important

- **Reproduce before you fix.** No exceptions. If you can't reproduce it, you don't understand it, and your fix is a guess.
- **Small fixes only.** If the bug fix requires significant architectural changes, it's not a bug fix — route to `grimoire-draft` for a proper change.
- **Don't over-document.** The test is the documentation. A one-line comment in the test explaining the bug is enough. Don't create tracking files, bug reports, or manifests for a bug fix.
- **The feature file is truth.** If a scenario describes behavior the user now says is wrong, that's a spec change, not a bug. Handle it through `grimoire-draft`.
- **One bug, one fix.** Don't bundle "while I'm in here" improvements with a bug fix. Fix the bug, nothing more.

## Done

When the bug is fixed, tests pass (reproduction + regression), and the summary is presented, the workflow is complete. Suggest `grimoire-commit` for the fix commit.
